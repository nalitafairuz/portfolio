# Portfolio
Hi, my name is Nalita! <br /><br />
I am a Computer Science fresh graduate specialising in Data Science and Artificial Intelligence. Previously, I was a Cloud Engineer Trainee at Cloud Kinetics here in Kuala Lumpur. In this role, I focused on gaining experience in AWS services and cloud migration projects.<br /><br />
The projects I am proud to share with you are Data Science related, in which I formed business questions, preprocessed data, conducted exploratory data analysis, and leveraged machine learning algorithms to make meaningful predictions. As an aspiring data scientist, I have also done presentations on my work to technical and non-technical audiences using impactful visualisations. <br /><br />
With my passion for leveraging the power of data and AI, I am eager to join a leading tech company to drive innovation and make a meaningful impact. Don't hesitate to contact me at nalitafairuz@gmail.com. Let's chat!

# Projects
##  Prediction of Fetal State using Classification Machine Learning
- Optimised a machine learning method to predict the classification of fetal state as normal, suspect, or pathological, based on cardiotocography (CTG) data. 
- Demonstrated EDA to discover missing data, outliers, duplicates, distribution of numerical data, the correlation between attributes, and representation of class labels in the dataset.
- Refined data pre-processing methods and fine-tuned SVM and ANN models to successfully achieve a 99% F1-Score using an oversampled dataset and early stopping on the ANN model.
